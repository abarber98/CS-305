# CS-305

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution looking to upgrade the security it uses for its existing application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Static testing played a huge role in identifying potential security risks in the software. Secure coding is important to protect the data of all users. This is especially important with a financial institution as the information on their servers will be very sensitive, making it even more important to use the safest practices. This also helps build your relationship with companies while ensuring their reputation is also upheld.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The dependency check was the most helpful. It made detecting vulnerabilities incredibly easy as well as showing the correct path to patch the vulnerabilities. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Updating the outdated libraries bolstered security as most of the vulnerabilities were caused by the old software. In the future, I would regularly run a dependency check and update the program as the vulnerabilities are identified.  

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran debugs in Eclipse frequently to ensure that the program was functional. After refactoring, I ran additional dependency checks to check if any new vulnerabilities were introduced.  

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Stack overflow, GitHub, and Eclipse error reporting helped me a lot.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

The use of hash functions to send encrypted communications would be at the top of my list. It was by far one of the most interesting topics to me and I feel like it is applicable to many professional scenarios.
